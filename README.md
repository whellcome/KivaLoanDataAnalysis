# Kiva Loan Data Analysis

### Unlocking Insights in Microfinance with Data Science

Welcome to the **Kiva Loan Data Analysis** project, a comprehensive exploration of microfinance data from Kiva.org. This repository offers a complete pipeline for preparing and analyzing loan data, transforming raw datasets into actionable insights through state-of-the-art methods and compelling visualizations.

---

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main components:

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   Innovative data cleaning, stratification, and feature engineering processes ensure the dataset is analysis-ready. Techniques include:
   - Filling missing values intelligently.
   - Stratifying data for balanced machine learning models.
   - Creating derived features to enrich the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:  
   Visual storytelling and statistical analysis are used to uncover trends and patterns in Kiva loans. Highlights include:
   - Interactive dashboards built with Plotly.
   - Static and dynamic visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Detailed analysis of loan distributions, repayment patterns, and demographic insights.
