# Kiva Analysis: Data Preparation (DM)

This repository contains the **Data Preparation** phase for the Kiva Loans dataset, forming the foundation of an extensive analytical study. The project aims to uncover meaningful insights from Kiva's global microloan data and ensure robust preprocessing for further exploratory and predictive analyses.

## Overview

The **Kiva Analysis: Data Preparation** notebook demonstrates a systematic approach to handling raw loan data. This phase involves:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and standardizing formats.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to enhance downstream analyses.
- **Outlier Handling:** Implementing a custom boundary identification algorithm to optimize the inclusion of meaningful data while mitigating noise.
- **Preparation for Visualization:** Structuring the dataset for visualization and model-ready formats.

This data preparation process ensures that the dataset is clean, enriched, and suitable for advanced analytics and visualization in subsequent stages.

## Highlights of the Custom Algorithm

One of the key innovations in this notebook is the custom **`outlers_get_borders`** algorithm, designed to identify and exclude data outliers iteratively. 

### **Algorithm Features**
- Uses **quantile-based boundaries** to progressively refine the dataset.
- Recursively narrows the bounds to ensure outliers are effectively removed without over-filtering valuable data.
- Outputs dynamically computed thresholds for cleaner data segmentation.

### **Future Prospects**
- Incorporating statistical validation for convergence to improve accuracy.
- Optimizing runtime for scalability with larger datasets.
- Adapting the algorithm to multidimensional data for complex feature analysis.

This algorithm represents a forward-thinking approach to outlier detection, tailored for datasets with uneven distributions and extreme values.
